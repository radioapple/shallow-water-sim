    shallow water simulation. The simulation is only for a rectangular "tub" with
    dimensions <Lx>x<Ly>, where the edges of the "tub" are considered to be rigid
    walls (i.e. we will take the x-component of the velocities to be 0 at the left
    and right edges and the y-component of the velocities to be 0 at the top and
    bottom edges. Also, 
    
    This function returns 3 KxMxN arrays:
            u: array containing the x-components of the velocity
            v: array containing the y-components of the velocity
            eta: array containing the height of the water above the undisturbed 
                 water level
    K is the time dimension, M is the y dimension, and N is the x dimension. Also,
    note that if you want to plot any of the final arrays with the x values horizonatally
    and the y values vertically, you have to tranpose the spatial dimensions of the 
    array. E.g. for eta, you would need to plot eta[time].transpose().
    
    Note that eta[:,1:,1:] contains the values while eta[:,0,:] and eta[:,:,0]
    are set to None. eta is padded this way to make the calculations easier. Also,
    for <u> and <v>, since the eta array is created in such a way that we have eta
    values at the edge of the "tub", the values u[:,:,0] and v[:,0,:] don't
    correspond to any physical location inside or at the edges of the tub.
        
    This function also uses the outside functions <plus_and_minus>, <uvh>, and
    <eta_star>.
    
    Note: H (the bathymetry function) should be defined before calling this function.
    Also, it should take in the y value first and then the x value. I.e. H(y,x).
    
    Parameters:
        Lx: x-dimension of the tub
        Ly: y-dimension of the tub
        T: total duration of the simulation in seconds
        eps: smoothing parameter (should be small, i.e. much less than 1, and positive)
        dx: step size for x-direction
        dy: step size for y-direction
        dt: time step
        init_cond: array of 3 arrays, each with the same dimensions as the values that
